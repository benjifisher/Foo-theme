Foo-theme
=========

A simple, but practical, example of a sub-theme for Drupal 7.

+   Simple:

    Every time you build a Drupal site, you should create a sub-theme of
    whatever theme you are using.  If you have never done this, it may help to
    look at this example.

+   Practical:

    The included CSS (partially cribbed from the docs) and jQuery (javascript)
    files build on the
    [Better exposed filters](http://drupal.org/project/better_exposed_filters)
    module.  If you have an exposed taxonomy filter for a view, then the module
    converts the clunky Select lists to nicer lists of checkboxes or radio
    buttons.  The CSS improves the display of the checkboxes, and the jQuery
    makes it so that when you select one taxonomy term, all its descendant terms
    are selected automatically.
