If you have never done this, it may help to\r\n    look at this example.\r\n\r\n+   Practical:\r\n\r\n    The included CSS (partially cribbed from the docs) and jQuery (javascript)\r\n    files build on the\r\n    [Better exposed filters](http://drupal.org/project/better_exposed_filters)\r\n    module.  If you have an exposed taxonomy filter for a view, then the module\r\n    converts the clunky Select lists to nicer lists of checkboxes or radio\r\n    buttons.  The CSS improves the display of the checkboxes, and the jQuery\r\n    makes it so that when you select one taxonomy term, all its descendant terms\r\n    are selected automatically.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
